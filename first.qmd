**Abstract**

Reproducibility and replication of studies and experiments an important
approach to gain confidence in conclusions. Quarto Document and Checkpoint
package helps us achieve reproducibility by sharing knowledge and techniques
used in procedures of studies more widespread, which contributes positive for generalizability
and robustness in procedures and framework of different studies and experiments.

**Introduction**

The effect of reproducibility is briefly explained and studied towards
the use of a Quarto Document and the Checkpoint package. By looking at
replicability the more data and information given about the procedures of an
experiment, give better reproducibility. To understand if the Quarto Document
and Checkpoint package helps to achieve reproducibility it is discussed in the
manner of generalizability, robustness and the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN), which the latter is a part of the Checkpoint package.

The literature review and the discussion gives an unequivocal result of the problem
studied.

**Reproducibility**

Science advances on a foundation of discoveries. To gain confidence in
a conclusion, reproducing an experiment is often used. To confirm results and
conclusions from one study, the approach of replicability is often used, whereas
the replicability is the confirmation of results and conclusions from one study
which is obtained independently from another. This is considered the scientific
gold standard.

Reproducibility methods refers to the provision of enough detail about study
and data so the same procedures could, in theory be repeated. Furthermore, obtaining
the same results from an independent study whose procedures are as closely replicated
to the original experiment as possible.

Robustness and generalizability can be used in lieu of the term
reproducibility. Robustness refers to the stability of experimental conclusions
to variations in either baseline assumptions or experimental procedures. Generalizability
refers to the persistence of an effect in procedures different from outside of
an experimental framework.

**Quarto document and Checkpoint package**

The goal of a Quarto document is to make scientific and technical documents better by creating and collaborating with a writing and publishing environment with integrated
tools for technical content.Â 

Quarto aims to make it easier to adopt a reproducible workflow, overarching
to replicate research and publications for a confirmation of conclusions
obtained independently in different studies. Enhancing reproducibility requires
that the code and data to create a procedure is an integrated part of the
research.

The checkpoint () function aims to solve the problem of package reproducibility in R. Checkpoint allows to install packages as they existed on Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN) on a specific date like a CRAN time machine. CRAN contains an archive of
different versions of the R distribution, documentation, and contributed R
packages.

To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint function installs the packages required or
called by the project and scripts to a local library exactly as they existed at
the specific point in time. Only those packages are available to a specified project,
thereby avoiding any package updates that came later which could have altered any
results.

**Discussion**

Research results from one study cannot always be verified whether they will
be correct or will remain correct as new information and new research becomes available.
Therefore, reproducibility is key to help contribute to other and future research
and verifying results. Providing transparency to the experiment will help
others to understand the procedure of the research. Replicating experiments and
achieving the same results and conclusions in one study obtained independently
in another adds confirmation the conclusion. Furthermore, reproducibility depends
on enough details and data to be replicated.Tracking and recording
changes during experimentation could thereby have significant value for
reproducibility. By adding new datasets, the changes could affect the outcome
of a model and results. Therefore, different dataset versions and changes should
be logged to achieve better reproducibility.

The Quarto Document\'s overarching goal is to make it easier to adopt a reproducible workflow
and using the Checkpoint package to this helps to keep track of the different R distribution versions, documentation, and contributed R packages.

Reproducibility should be positively affected using Quarto Document and
the additional Checkpoint package whereas the CRAN archive contributes by avoiding
package updates which could alter research study results, hereby considering replication
of experiments and the specific procedures executed to achieve the reported
results. In addition, the Quarto Document aims to enhance a collaborating publishing
environment by providing tools for technical content which in term could be positive
for generalizability of an effect in procedures. Also, the stability of experimental conclusions and variations of procedures could help achieve better reproducibility.

**Conclusion**

The overarching goal of the Quarto
Document and Checkpoint package is to enhance reproducibility by making knowledge
and techniques used in procedures of studies more widespread. As discussed,
reproducibility depends on, and is better replicated the more details and
information given regarding procedures and framework of an experiment.

The conclusion of the problem is therefore that Quarto Document and Checkpoint
package does indeed contribute to help achieve reproducibility.
