Most R scripts rely on packages, but new versions of packages are released daily. To ensure that results from R are reproducible, it’s important to run R scripts using exactly the same package version in use when the script was written.}

  abstract = {Together, the checkpoint package and the checkpoint server act as a CRAN time machine. The create\_checkpoint function installs the packages referenced in the specified project to a local library exactly as they existed at the specified point in time.  Only those packages are available to your session, thereby avoiding any package updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using the use\_checkpoint function can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any time. The checkpoint function serves as a simple umbrella interface to these functions. It first tests if the checkpoint exists, creates it if necessary with create\_checkpoint, and then calls use\_checkpoint.},
